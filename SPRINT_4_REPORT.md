# Sprint 4 Report â€“ End-to-End Testing

## Overview
This sprint focused on validating the complete maintenance workflow from an admin request through automated pull request generation.

## Completed Work
- Simulated an admin creating a maintenance request, generating a plan, and invoking the automated agent.
- Added a comprehensive integration test that covers chat streaming, plan creation, and running the auto-coder.
- Cleaned up test artifacts to keep the repository tidy.
- Updated documentation to describe running the end-to-end test and troubleshooting failures.
- Marked sprint tasks as complete in `MAINTENANCE_PAGE_PLAN_AGILE.md`.

## Testing Summary
- `pytest backend/tests/test_maintenance.py::test_full_maintenance_workflow`
- `npm test --prefix frontend`

## Analysis
The integration test exercises the core maintenance flow without requiring external services. By mocking the LLM and git operations, the test confirms that the system saves plan files, triggers backend and frontend test commands, and stages a commit. Documentation now guides developers on executing this workflow and resolving missing dependency issues, ensuring the maintenance feature remains auditable and reliable.
