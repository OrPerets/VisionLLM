# Manual URL lists

Place optional product-specific URL seed lists here. One URL per line; lines starting with `#` are ignored.

Example files:
- `snowflake.txt`
- `dbt.txt`
- `tableau.txt`

Use these to include important pages that are missing from sitemaps or are intentionally excluded but still desirable (e.g., changelogs, deep references).
